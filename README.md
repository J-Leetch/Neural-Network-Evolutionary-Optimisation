# Neural Network Evolutionary Optimisation (Flappy Bird)
A fun attempt at optimising a neural network for playing a simple game similar to 'flappy bird'- a classic example seen on YouTube.  A challenge for myself done in spare time after 1st year exams. It gave surprisingly good results considering its simplicity and that it was a first attempt, starting from zero knowledge and without using any machine learning libraries etc.
